# Minimal Vaadin App with WildflySwarm
Everything was better before; or easier. That applies at least to web design. Even if it was not necessarily better then. JAXenter author Sven Ruppert (Vaadin) wishes for the simplicity of bygone days and shows in his series of articles how to build user interfaces for the Web as a veteran Java backend developer.

## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
